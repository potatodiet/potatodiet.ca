title: "Annoying Incident on the LRT in Waterloo"
---

I was on the ION light rail in Waterloo while a fare inspector made his rounds.
When he made his way to me, I tapped my card on his reader, and he said "It
wasn’t valid". When I tapped to get on the train, there was a weird noise, but I
couldn’t see the message on the screen due to sun blur, so I assumed the fare
inspector was right: my card was invalid. But recently I was checking my card’s
history, and I discovered I didn’t do anything wrong.

I initially rode a bus, waited at an appointment for a while, and then
transferred to the train. When I tapped to get on the train, I was within the
time window for a free transfer, but by the time the fare inspector arrived, I
was out of the window, and so my card was now invalid. This is really annoying.
What was I supposed to do? get off the train and retap when I was out of the
transfer window? I tapped to get on the train, and I should be allowed to travel
to my destination.

Luckily, the fare inspector didn’t have any problems since I was getting off at
the exact time he inspected my card. In the moment, I thought I was wrong and
was mentally prepared to pay a fine. Now I’m annoyed at the fact that I did
nothing wrong.
