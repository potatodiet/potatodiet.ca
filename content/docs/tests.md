## MBTI
I don't have records, but I first performed a few MBTI tests around 2015 - 2017 and would consistently be marked as INTP, with a few tests rarely giving me INTJ. Perhaps I'm just biased since I first was marked as INTP, but I'd classify myself as INTP. I also would classify MBTI as 60% true on the truth-astrology scale.
