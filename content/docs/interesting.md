## Interesting Projects
### Jellyfin
[Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) is a self-hosted home media solution. The project was created as a fork of [Emby](https://emby.media/) after the lead-developer made the project closed sourced. I think of the project as a great example of open source collaboration, as there doesn't seem to be a single developer running the show like with Emby. Overall though there's far too much technical debt due to the general architecture which has resulted in a somewhat poor experience for myself.

## Interesting Areas of the Internet
### Lindybeige
[Lindybeige](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9pgQfOXRsp4UKrI8q0zjXQ) is what I think of as a perfect humanities professor. He goes on hour-long unscripted talks about topics which deeply interests him and which normally interests myself as well. Most of his videos are focused on history or military history. 

### Gwern
[Gwern](https://gwern.net) is the pseudonyme of someone who gained popularity in the rationalsphere from his writing on [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com), and, at least in my subjective opinion, exploded in popularity later on due to his research into darknet markets.
