## Interesting Projects

### Jellyfin

[Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) is a self-hosted home media
solution. The project was created as a fork of [Emby](https://emby.media/) after
the lead-developer made the project closed sourced. I think of the project as a
great example of open source collaboration, as there doesn't seem to be a single
developer running the show like with Emby. Overall though there's far too much
technical debt due to the general architecture which has resulted in a somewhat
poor experience for myself.

### SerenityOS

[SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) is a modern operating
system made in homage to computing in the 90's. The operating system by itself
isn't that interesting by itself. What makes it stand out from other hobbyist
operating systems like [Redux](https://github.com/redox-os/redox) are the videos
which the lead developer,
[Andreas Kling](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling), releases on his YouTube
channel documenting his workflow and problem solving.

## Interesting Areas of the Internet

### Lindybeige

[Lindybeige](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9pgQfOXRsp4UKrI8q0zjXQ) is what I
think of as a perfect humanities professor. He goes on hour-long unscripted
talks about topics which deeply interests him and which normally interests
myself as well. Most of his videos are focused on history or military history.

### Gwern

[Gwern](https://gwern.net) is the pseudonyme of someone who gained popularity in
the rationalsphere from his writing on [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com), and,
at least in my subjective opinion, exploded in popularity later on due to his
research into darknet markets.
