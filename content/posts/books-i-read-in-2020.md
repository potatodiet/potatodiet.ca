## Map and Territory

> by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Overall I was unimpressed and found no value from Yudkowsky's writing.

## Essays by the LessWrong Community

> by an assortment of authors

Again, I was unimpressed by almost all of the essays written in this collection
of the best LessWrong essays compiled into book form.

My only real connection to the rationalist community is through, first reading
Gwern who I love, and then discovering the /r/slatestarcodex subreddit through
Eric Weinstein which I discovered was full of very interesting discussions.
Later on I discovered LessWrong is where this rationalist community was created,
including Gwern and Scott Alexander, the author of Slate Star Codex which the
subreddit formed around.

I love the rationalist community, but hate the essays outside of Gwern and Scott
Alexander.

## Pacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941-1942

> by Ian Toll

The first of a trilogy about the pacific theatre.

Perhaps the most interesting history book I've read. I've read reviews which
claim Toll writes fiction-like non-fiction, in the sense that there's a
narrative story which keeps you hooked. I found this to be completely true, at
least when it came to the more grand broad strategy chapters of the book. The
more tactics focused specific battle retellings just wasn't something which
interests me. I don't really care that an aircraft carrier was receiving
landings at 10:20, re-arming the landed planes at 10:50, and launching again at
11:30 to give a made up example.

The strategy was 5/5, tactics 3/5 for me, at least when it comes to personal
interest, not quality-wise, in that case it would be 5/5.
