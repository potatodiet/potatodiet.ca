  The generic advice on keeping your room clean is surprisingly helpful.

It's essentially a meme at this point, but the standard advice given to those in
a disorderly state - clean your room - shouldn't be dismissed. I see there being
two main benefits.

First, having your local environment be clean and well organized helps set the
mood for implying your life is proper as well, and you should then be acting as
a proper person does as that's what your room says about yourself.

Second, the act of cleaning your room, especially the initial act of cleaning a
disorderly room, requires a minor, yet still useful, shift of your mindset. Once
you begin, you're now someone who brings stability out of chaos, and if you can
do that in the minor way of cleaning your room, well maybe you can do that in a
slightly more meaningful way, recursively moving up the meaningfulness
hierarchy. Eventually you're bringing stability to truly meaningful disorderly
areas of your life.

Cleaning your room is a minor step towards a better life.
