## Pascal's Wager

> - God is, or God is not. Reason cannot decide between the two alternatives
> - A Game is being played... where heads or tails will turn up
> - You must wager (it is not optional)
> - Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate
>   these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing
> - Wager, then, without hesitation that He is. (...) There is here an infinity
>   of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite
>   number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. And so our
>   proposition is of infinite force when there is the finite to stake in a game
>   where there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.
> - But some cannot believe. They should then 'at least learn your inability to
>   believe...' and 'Endeavour then to convince' themselves.

Pascal's wager shouldn't be taken too seriously as it comes from his private
notes which were published after his death. Nevertheless, here's my unoriginal
critisism.

1. There's no reason to think that believing in some general concept of a God
   will lead to benefits in the afterlife. It's just as plausable that if a God
   exists, believing in it leads to a Hell, with non-belief leading to a Heaven.
2. If you believe in a specific God, you're excluding many other Gods. You can't
   believe in Christianity as well an Tengrism without contradiction. If you
   pick the wrong God, you may be punished more than simply believing in none.

## Why One Religion Over The Other?

If you're religious, why would you have faith in your religion being correct,
with all other religions being incorrect? What would lead someone to believe
such a thing? Most people surely are aware their religion isn't the only
religion out there. There's billions of people believing in a different faith
than you.

My ex-Muslim friend told me that he was taught all other gods are really just
his god, and he thought this was a perfectly good solution. But I don't
understand how this solves the issue. Other religions are mistaken in their
belief, sure. They believe in a god, yet their god is really just the Muslim
god. But they don't agree with that. They are likely think the same towards the
Muslim god. What makes your belief your version of god more likely than others'
version of god?
