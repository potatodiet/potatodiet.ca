900,000 international students will enter Canada in 2023. 500,000 will enter the
UK in 2023. 305,000 entered Australia in 2022. 410,000 entered the USA in 2022.
For a country with such a low population, Canada has a large number of
international students. If we scale every country's population up to the USA,
7,900,000 would enter Canada in 2023, 2,510,000 would enter the UK in 2023, and
3,900,000 would have entered Australia in 2022.

Assuming Canada is able to retain most of the international university students,
the country is probably better off with its current policy. The problem is that
the vast majority of international students aren't university students, they're
college students. In Ontario in 2022, 63% of approved study permits were for
college students and 18% were for university students.

![Most study permits are for college; study permits issued for colleges rose sharply between 2020-2022.](/ontario-study-permits-by-level.png "New Study Permits Approved by Study Level, Ontario, 2016-2022")

Some colleges confer bachelor's degrees, but the majority are 2-3 year diploma
programs. 4 year degree programs are fine. 2-3 year diploma programs are
dubious. 1 year certificate programs are an issue. When I refer to college
generically, I'll be excluding 4 year bachelor programs.

College is meant to increase class mobility. It's meant to raise people born to
lower class households into the middle class. It's meant to lift people out of
poverty. Granting study permits to attend college makes little sense.
