Hello, I'm Justin M. Kidd.

I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Toronto. Previously
I was a software developer intern at SOTI.

I'm a full-stack developer experienced with React, ASP.NET Core, Ruby on Rails,
and Django.

I'm a heavy proponent of containerization. I think software
developers should own the deploy process for the software they write. I think
less is more when it comes to code: concise and terse is better than repetitive
and verbose.

I enjoy history, politics, philosophy, and knowledge in general.
