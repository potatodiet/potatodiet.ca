Hello, I'm Justin M. Kidd.

I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Toronto. Previously
I was a software developer intern at SOTI.

I'm a software developer specialized in full-stack web development and DevOps.
I have experience with React, ASP.NET Core, Ruby on Rails, Django, Docker,
and Linux.

I prefer ergonomic type-safe languages like C#, TypeScript, and Rust. However,
dynamically-typed languages like Python, Ruby, Bash, and even PowerShell fill a
niche in scripting.

I'm a heavy proponent of containerization. I think software
developers should own the deploy process for the software they write. I think
less is more when it comes to code: concise and terse is better than repetitive
and verbose.

I enjoy history, politics, philosophy, and the pursuit of knowledge in general.
