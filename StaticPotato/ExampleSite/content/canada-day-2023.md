title: "Canada Day 2023"
---

2023 was the first time in at least 10 years that I did anything special on
Canada Day. I went into Toronto with Ellie and her parents. We first went to the
St. Lawrence Market, buying a carton of delicious soft strawberries. Afterwards,
we visited Centre Island by ferry.

The line to purchase ferry tickets was far too long. The line to show your
tickets had no wait time. After seeing this, we bought our tickets online. It
seems odd to me that more people in the line didn't do the same. Once we got
into the waiting area, it was an overcrowded mess. The center of the area had no
overhead, leaving us exposed to the sweat inducing sun. Once the ferry arrived,
the waiting crowd cheared more enthusiastically than I was expecting.

Centre Island was alright, but nothing spectacular.
