Everything here is my subjective opinion. Don't take anything authoritatively.

## Clothing

- Uniqlo Ultra Warm HEATTECH shirts are perfect for -10 to 0 GTA weather. I
  can wear the shirt, and a down coat while remaining warm. Normally I need to
  wear multiple layers of a shirt, sweater, and coat to remain warm. Maybe the
  shirts will lose their warmth protection in time though.

## Food

- Wonder Bread is awful. I heavily prefer Dempster's.
- Generic hot dogs are fine.
- Dempster's The Gold Buns are good. However, generic Great Value buns at half
  the price of Dempster's are fine.
