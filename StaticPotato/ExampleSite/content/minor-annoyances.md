- Historical movies which have someone use the word "fire" to command archers to
  shoot their arrows. Before firearms were invented, fire had no relation to
  shooting. They should be using the word "nock".
- Historical movies which have someone commanding archers to shoot their arrows.
  This essentially didn't happen. This idea comes from the period where we had
  line infantry. There's no benefit to having archers wait to shoot. If they can
  shoot, then they just should.
- Historial movies which have archers setting their arrows on fire. Arrows are
  meant to pierce an enemy's armour. Setting your arrow on fire doesn't help it
  pierce better. The fire isn't going to help kill your enemy. Fire arrows were
  only useful when sieging a city, since you could set building on fire.
