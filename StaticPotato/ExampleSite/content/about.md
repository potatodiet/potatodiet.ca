## Overview

I never graduated or even really attended high school, but I somehow ended up
with my current status as a struggling Computer Science student at the
University of Toronto, which I [wrote about](/uoft/).

At age 13 I spent most of my days playing flash games. By chance I discovered a
tutorial on how to develop a snake-clone on the Kongregate forums. I copied the
presented code, changed one line to change the snake's colour, and called myself
a game developer. I started a game studio but never made any successful games
due to lacking an understanding of game development or programming at the time.
I wish I had any of the material I created back then, or at least remembered the
name of the studio.

## Personality Tests

### MBTI

I don't have records, but I first performed a few MBTI tests around 2015 - 2017
and would consistently be marked as INTP, with a few tests rarely giving me
INTJ. Perhaps I'm just biased since I first was marked as INTP, but I'd classify
myself as INTP. I also would classify MBTI as 60% true on the truth-astrology
scale.
