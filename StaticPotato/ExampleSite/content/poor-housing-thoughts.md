## Building Non-affordable Housing is Bad.

If a builder wants to construct a new condo in the heart of a densely populated
city, and wants to target more expensive non-affordable rooms only, it's a net
positive for housing stock and drives down the price of housing. Many people
have the poorly researched thought that investors are for some reason purchasing
these expensive condos in a way that excludes them from the market; as if
they're buying the housing with no intent to rent out.

A 1 bedroom apartment in a city like Toronto could easily rent for $3000 a
month. If an investor decides not to rent out his newly purchased non-affordable
condo, he's giving up $36000 a year in profit, minus fees such as rental
management fees. This would be an awful financial investment.

Instead, investors desire to maximize their investment and rationally decide to
rent out their property. This increases the supply and thus causes a right shift
in the supply curve, resulting in a lower demand-supply intersection, leading to
a lower price.

Even if you consider a divide between affordable housing and non affordable
housing, where their supply should be considered separate. This still involves
higher earners moving out of existing affordable housing, lowering the demand
for affordable housing, and lowering the price of affordable housing.
